Look at the original mod for description:
Hideout Party Unlimited at Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Nexus

Updated to Version 1.2.7.

The main portions work. You can:
- Lead all your troops into hideouts on foot.
- Pull in nearby bandit parties to the fight.

Unfortunately, the simulated battles do not work correctly.
They always resolve to 0-0 losses with a win for the player, basically guaranteeing a bunch of prisoners.
Hopefully someone more interested than me would like to try their hand at fixing it.
