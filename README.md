Look at the original mod for description.

Hideout Party Unlimited at Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord Nexus

== Tested on beta branch (1.2.3)

Didn't test a lot. Did one hideout raid during the day with a bunch of troops and bandits and it seemed to work well enough. Hopefully there aren't any issues because I don't have the intuition that would come from creating this mod from scratch.

The author said they caught covid and would update the mod, but hasn't done so. Hope they're okay.
